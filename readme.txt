Step-1 : Download Binaries required to exceucute code 

->G-drive link to download binary files for Augmented_Dataset,Extracted_features,Weights&Bias 
1."https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dY4lApdLcfY0adqOOZtj7nJx7MiYetLd?usp=sharing"
2."aug_data_batch_1 ...5.bin" : are binary files having augmented dataset
3."aug1.bin" : Unaugmented dataset extracted features file
4."aug2.bin" : Augmented dataset extracted features file
5."aug3.bin" : Test dataset extracted features file 
6."Aug_dataset_Weights.bin" : contains weights and bias values for model trained on augmented dataset
7."Main_dataset_Weights.bin" : contains weights and bias values for model trained on Unaugmented dataset
8."DL_assignment1.pdf": Report for assignment. 

Step-2 :I have used Single Jupyter notebook complete the assignment(DL_assignment_1.ipynb).

Step-3 :Path where you should place all binaries is "/home/piyushg/Codes/".
note: I have Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Step-4: Put main dataset on same path as mentioned above(cifar-10-batches-py).

Step-5: Start compiling Jupyter notebook from top cell to bottom one.I have added markdown cells mentioning each question that is being solved in order to make notebook more readable.
